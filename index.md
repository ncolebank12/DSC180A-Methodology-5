**1. What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**

The most interesting topic covered in my domain this quarter is literature extraction. This has been a complex task that typically uses LLMs to perform the extraction. There is some research on it already, and they present some potential ideas like fine-tuning using strategies such as LLaMA-Adapter.

**2. Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 project.**

An investigation I would like to pursue for our Quarter 2 project is predicting passivating molecules based on the database we create from literature extraction. This could then be used to test previously untested passivating molecules in a lab setting, leading to potential improvements in the perovskite research domain.

**3. What is a potential change you'd like to make to the approach taken in your Quarter 1 Project?**

One potential change I'd like to make to the approach taken in the Quarter 1 Project is focusing more on applying different machine learning models to the same problem. This would entail testing out many different approaches for predicting passivating molecules based on our dataset.

**What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**

I would be interested in incorporating data extraction from images/figures for Quarter 2. There is currently a lot of data that is only stored in figures, especially related to stability testing. Incorporating this technique would give our model more accurate data to work with.
